# Type-erased dataset prototype

## FAQ

1. Why not workspaces with virtual interface to provide common functionality?
   - Common virtual interfaces are already running into trouble with the current workspaces.
     With more and more generic workspace types we would not be getting anywhere.

1. Why not with static typing of columns, i.e., similar to `std::tuple<Ts...>`?
   - Yields an unreasonably large number of workspace types that probably cannot be handled efficiently in terms of compile times, code size, and complete Python exports.
   - Does not cover cases where we require flexibility at runtime, such as for generic tables.

1. Why not units in type?
   - This is not 100% clear yet, but probably this also yields a unmanageably large number of column types?

1. Why not a nested structure of table-like objects?
   - Apart from an easier implementation of methods for selecting certain slices from a `Dataset` this does not seem to provide advantages and only increases complexity.

1. Why not histograms as the smallest element in a `Dataset`?
   - Cannot handle sharing of the x-axis (bin edges) in an easy way.
     There current approach via copy-on-write pointers has a couple of drawbacks:
     - Complex histogram API.
     - No good way to check for shared axis.
     - Cumbersome client code for maintaining sharing.
   - Could support histograms as the smallest element if we can do without sharing the axis.
     - Some memory overhead.
     - Compute overhead if all histograms have the same axis.
