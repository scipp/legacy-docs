# Beamline in Dataset

This document focuses on what would be required to complete the rollout of Instrument 2.0 (aka Beamline) in Mantid, in it's current state. Since Dataset can and will support all Geometry, we can use these estimates to inform the rollout strategy and effort for Geometry in Dataset.
